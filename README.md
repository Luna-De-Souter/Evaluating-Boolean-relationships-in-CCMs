# Evaluating-Boolean-relationships-in-CCMs
This repository contains supplementary material for the research article 'Evaluating Boolean relationships in Configurational Comparative Methods': https://doi.org/10.1515/jci-2023-0014.

def_contrapositives.R contains definitions of functions to calculate contrapositive consistency and contrapositive coverage, as well as examples on how to use these functions.

The folder 'Simulation experiment' contains R scripts and data of the simulation experiment discussed in the article:

simulation_script.R runs the experiment.

disc_contr_19jan.csv contains the results generated by simulation_script.R.

plots_script.R makes plots for summarizing the results of the experiment and calculates standard errors of the plotted means.
